(** Consider the following problem. Suppose we are in a 100-story
building. We know that, when dropping an egg from the window, the egg
will stay intact if we are below a certain floor. However, if we
repeat the same exercise above that critical floor, the egg will
break. How can we find this floor and minimize the number of egg drops
performed in the worst case if we have only two eggs? We suppose that
we are allowed to reuse eggs that fall without breaking.

We will see how we can model this problem in Coq and find a correct
solution. We model a playing strategy as a decision tree: *)

Inductive strategy : Type :=
| Guess (floor : nat)
| Drop  (floor : nat) (broken intact : strategy).

(** In the above definition, [Guess floor] represents the end of the
algorithm, when we try to guess the target floor. If [floor] is equal
to the target, we win the game; otherwise, we lose. [Drop floor broken
intact] represents an egg drop at [floor]. If the egg breaks, we
continue playing with strategy [broken]; otherwise, we continue with
[intact].

Simulating an egg-drop game is just a matter of performing a tree
search. [play target s] returns [true] if and only if strategy [s]
succeeds in guessing floor [target]. *)

Fixpoint play (target : nat) (s : strategy) : bool :=
  match s with
  | Guess floor =>
    beq_nat floor target
  | Drop floor broken intact =>
    play target (if leb target floor then broken
                 else intact)
  end.

(** We can also find how many eggs a strategy needs and how many drops
are performed in the worst case. [drops] just computes the strategy
tree height, whereas [eggs] computes a "skewed" height, where right
branches do not add to the final value. *)

Fixpoint eggs (s : strategy) : nat :=
  match s with
  | Guess _ => 0
  | Drop _ broken intact => max (S (eggs broken)) (eggs intact)
  end.

Fixpoint drops (s : strategy) : nat :=
  match s with
  | Guess _ => 0
  | Drop _ broken intact => S (max (drops broken) (drops intact))
  end.

(** Finally, using these concepts, we can describe what the solution
for our problem is. [winning lower range s] says that strategy [s] is
able to find [range] target floors starting at [lower], while
[is_optimal range e d] states that there is a winning strategy for
guessing [range] target floors, uses at most [e] eggs and performing
at most [d] drops, such that [d] is the smallest possible. *)

Definition winning (lower range : nat) (s : strategy) : Prop :=
  forall target, lower <= target < lower + range ->
                 play target s = true.

Definition is_optimal (range e d : nat) : Prop :=
  exists s : strategy,
    eggs s <= e /\
    drops s = d /\
    winning 0 range s /\
    forall s', eggs s' <= e ->
               winning 0 range s' ->
               d <= drops s'.

(** ** A simple first strategy

Before trying to find an optimal solution, let us try to find one that
works. A simple strategy is to perform linear search, starting at the
bottom and going up one floor at a time. As soon as the egg breaks, we
know that we have found our target. *)

Fixpoint linear (lower range : nat) : strategy :=
  match range with
  | 0 => Guess lower
  | S range' => Drop lower (Guess lower) (linear (S lower) range')
  end.

(** [linear lower range] works on a range of [S range] floors, using
at most one egg. Because of this, it is not very efficient, performing
[n] drops in the worst case. *)

(** ** Improving our strategy

Now that we know a naive search strategy, we will try to find an
optimal one. Intuitively, it seems that it should be possible to
perform some form of binary search, starting at the middle of our
floor range, and continuing recursively depending on the outcome of
our drop. *)

(** Although much better than a pure linear strategy, this is still
far from being optimal: if our egg doesn't break on our first drop, we
will still be using at most only one egg on that upper range. If we
allowed ourselves to break one of them, presumably, we would be able
to solve the upper range in less than 50 drops, which would in turn
allow us to perform our first drop at a lower floor, e.g. *)

(** Our new solution performs much better, but there is still room for
improvement. Once again, if our first two drops are below the target
floor, we will be using only one egg to search through 33 floors,
which could be done better if we had used both of them. This suggests
that the optimal strategy should be some form of skewed binary search,
where the upper range that is produced by an egg drop should use its
available eggs in an optimal way.

** Finding the optimum

How can we formalize the intuition that we just developed? The key
insight is to reason by _duality_ and, instead, ask "what is the
largest range of floors we can scan using at most some number of eggs
and drops?" When looking at the problem this way, it becomes clear
that optimality has a recursive structure that is easy to describe: to
find a floor using at most [e] eggs and [d] drops, we need to combine
two optimal strategies: one using at most [e-1] eggs and [d-1] drops,
for the case where our first drop causes the egg to break, and another
using at most [e] eggs and [d-1] drops, for the case where our egg
does not break at first. We can readily express this idea as
code. [optimal_range e d] computes the maximal range size that can be
solved using [e] eggs and [d] drops at most, while [optimal lower e d]
computes a strategy for doing so starting from floor [lower]. *)

Fixpoint optimal_range_minus_1 (e d : nat) {struct d} : nat :=
  match d, e with
  | S d', S e' => S (optimal_range_minus_1 e' d' +
                     optimal_range_minus_1 (S e') d')
  | _, _ => 0
  end.

Definition optimal_range e d := S (optimal_range_minus_1 e d).

Fixpoint optimal (lower e d : nat) {struct d} : strategy :=
  match d, e with
  | S d', S e' =>
    let floor := lower + optimal_range_minus_1 e' d' in
    Drop floor
         (optimal lower e' d')
         (optimal (S floor) (S e') d')
  | _, _ => Guess lower
  end.

d] floors, as well that it uses the resources that we expect. *)
